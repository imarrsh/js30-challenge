    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // variables pass by value
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name = 'marshall';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = 'marshall thompson';
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    // pass by sharing!!
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; // is actually a reference to players

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players); // players[3] is now 'Lux'

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. 
    // They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[0] = 'Tripp';
    console.log(team2);
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[2] = 'Joanne' ;
    console.log(team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[2] = 'Joseph';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team5[1] = 'Rupert';
    console.log(team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Marshall Thompson',
      age: 30,
      social: {
        twitter: 'marshallthomp',
        facebook: 'marshallthompson'
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    person2.age = 45;
    console.log(person, person2); // pass by reference
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // REALLY simple way:
    const person3 = {};   
    for (key in person) {
      person3[key] = person[key];
    }
    person3.name = 'Joe Buddin';
    person3.social.twitter = 'joebuggin';
    console.log(person3);

    // Wes Bos solution:
    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 50}); // break off references
    console.log(captain);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
